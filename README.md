This is my fork of the [Synthwave x Fluoromachine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webrender.synthwave-x-fluoromachine) theme, tweaked for higher contrast and screen share legibility.

I'm mainly using it for Rust and C and have designed it for personal use, but am happy to hear about any feedback!


## that's... an odd name for a theme

It's a reference to a exercise book & apparel line by 80s bodybuilder [Rachel McLish](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_McLish).
